This repo contains code of my first ruby on rails app made.
(Sorry for bad way of coding, and completely ruining MVC, as it was my first time with rails)

Application Features :
1. 4pic 1word game
2. Questions can be CRUD using login "shivam" p: jaadu123
3. Users can be CRUD using login "shivam"
4. Signup feature
5. omniauth for FB and GITHUB login.
6. Recommend a friend using email.
7. Leaderboard
8. Different levels with different time limits. (Easy JS implementation, easy to hack.. :P )
9. User can CRU on his/her profile.

And saying yet again, it was first app in rails, so many many things have not been made as they should have been. Yet, it might be useful for many.. :)
